Methodology for QSR Sales Forecast Model

Objective

Create a predictive model to forecast daily and hourly sales for QSR locations, supporting production planning and staffing decisions.

Approach

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and align historical sales data (store_id, date, time, quantity_sold), filtering anomalies like store closures.
2. Feature Engineering: Explore predictors such as lagged sales, 7-day rolling averages, holidays, and day of week.
3. Model Development: Use time series techniques (e.g., ARIMA) or machine learning (e.g., XGBoost) for hourly/daily forecasts.
4. Evaluation: Assess accuracy with MAPE, aiming for <10% for daily and <12% for hourly predictions.
5. Deliverables: Exportable forecasts (CSV), documentation, and optional Power BI dashboard.

Tools

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- R (for statistical analysis)
- Power BI (visualization)

Next Steps

- Expand dataset with real data.
- Implement and test forecasting models.
